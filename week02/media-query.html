                And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is
                Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his
                mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat
                upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because
                of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they
                cannot fall.

            <p>
                And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that
                they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they
                humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.
